# How to contribute

For the VS Code template, we use this tutorial to generate it.

[Your First Extension.](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)

`F5` to run the debugger. This runs our extension.

`yarn watch` is going to compile our extension.ts to the /dist folder. Webpack transpiles your code. It takes our extension.ts and turns it to extension.js

`ctrl + shift + p` on our extension window, you can run a command of the extension.

Here is an example of the image.
