# How to contribute

For the VS Code template, we use this tutorial to generate it.

[Your First Extension.](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)

`Ctrl + F5` to run the debugger. This runs our extension.

`yarn watch` is going to compile our extension.ts to the /dist folder. Webpack transpiles your code. It takes our extension.ts and turns it to extension.js

`ctrl + shift + p` on our extension window, you can run a command of the extension.

Here is an example of the image(To add images in md, user GitHub user content).

[More info here on how to add image using GitHub user content](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61537403/how-to-host-image-at-https-user-images-githubusercontent-com-path-filename)

Every time you make a change to the extension code, you need to reload the `[Extension Development Host]`

To reload, you open the command pallette, `ctrl + shift +p` then you type `reload` then select the reload command.
